# Reactive Cloud Lamp

This is a repo for a reactive cloud lamp I made for a lighting competition sponsored by Lutron, held at Boston University.
When a certain sound threshold is reached (claping level) an LED strip inside the cloud flashes according to a randomly choosen flash
pattern. 

The base of the lamp features two laser cut images - the front one depicts a slumped man walking, the other is the same man but kicking a heart.
Two LED strips connected to a relay light up one of the images every 1.5 seconds, while the other image is dark. This allows the viewer
to see initally just see the slumped man and then a second later the same man is shown but his internal conflict is made evident by the 
heart he is kicking. The thunder cloud flashes and his predicament is revealed without him being able to control it. 

The title is **Inside Out**
